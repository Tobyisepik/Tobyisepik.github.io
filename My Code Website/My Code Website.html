            If there isn't, it will not waste its time trying to decipher boat numbers from water.

                    using a linear regression model, with help from VGG16. This is to make it easier for the later models to make correct decisions.
                    This model is trained on about a couple thousand training images. 
                    This is done as illustrated here:

                    From that cropped image, another softmax model would work out the type of boat it is, which is one component to 
                    signing people on. The current boat types identifiable by the model are: 29er, Laser, Solo, Aero, Tera and Feva. 
                    In later versions, I would make more categories as there a alot more boats than that, but those are the popular boats.

        <h2>Finally, the numbers are converted into a dictionary, meaning that they do not care for order (as it is impossible to have it in order),
            and are compared to all numbers (also as dictionaries) in the online graphql database, which I accessed through the use of the requests python library.
            There is a points system which I put in place to give rarer boats more chance to be signed on with numbers that are a bit off,
            as there is less chance of signing the wrong person on. For example, the Laser, which is a common boat, would need a more harsh points
            system as there are a lot of people with similar sail numbers, meaning I wouldn't want to sign someone who is 
            not racing, but has similar sail numbers, on to the race. This is only needed as I need to give the models a chance to actually 
            read any boats on to the website. The boat should hopefully be signed on from there.

            First, a boat is decided to be in the picture, then it is outlined, then it's type is decided, 
            and boat number outined, both from the cropped image. Next, the cropped boat number is then divided into its numbers,
            and then those numbers are read. The full number is judged as to whether it is accurate enough to any boats(in the database),
            and is then signed on.

        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <h2>
            I hope to have tried my model on some real-life data by the end of march, and improve it
            from there to actually be functional, but apart from that the project has been incredibly 
            fun for me to work on, as it is something I love, Sailing, and learning about Machine Learning has
            been fascinating!

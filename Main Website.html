                I want to pair my 2 favourite things: coding, and Sailing.
                In a world where machine learning looks like it can do anything,
                I wanted machine learning to aid sailing, by signing people on to races 
                without having to write their names onto a sign-on sheet. This would be very 
                helpful with my brothers website, that works, but a core problem is that it takes 
                alot of time to sign people on with his website, rather than just having every
                sailor sign themselves on. I have been working on my script to aid my brothers website.
                My Script, is divided into many parts, which I will explain in the "My Code" link at the
                top.
